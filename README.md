Welcome, Unkindled. I am Stanley — a software developer, engineer, and ever-curious tinkerer of machines and madness.  
My path is that of arcane code and digital embers — traversing landscapes forged in C#, .NET, Python, and embedded systems.

I work on:
- ⚔️ **Soulslike APIs** — RESTful designs as elegant as a parry.
- 🔥 **IoT Artifacts** — ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and other cursed relics.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Rituals** — YOLO, PyTorch, and forbidden knowledge.
- 🗺️ **GIS Cartography** — QGIS + HLURB zoning; painting maps like the world of Lothric.

## 🕯️ Current Quest
> *“May your purpose be unwavering, your code bug-free.”*

🔧 Building a real-time maturity detection system for **Cocos nucifera** using image processing and embedded hardware.  
🛠️ Crafting APIs for a recruitment platform — stable, secure, and scalable.  
🌞 Mapping the solar energy future of the Philippines (2025–2035) one milestone at a time.
